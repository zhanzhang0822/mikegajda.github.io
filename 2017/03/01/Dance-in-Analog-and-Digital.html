    <meta name="description" content="Dance in Analog and Digital is my Interactive Media Arts(IMA) capstone/thesis project. It is to visualize the difference of human movement using analog and digital methods. To do this, I will simultaneously record a solo dance performance with both long-exposure film photography and a Microsoft Kinect’s depth and motion sensing. The deliverable will be a sequence of imaging chronicling the entire dance performance into an estimated 20 different fragments. The viewer will then be able to view each fragment as a long exposure film print, as a representation of analog means, and an interactive lenticular that will allow the viewer to see a short video clip by changing their perspective, as a representation of digital means. The fragments will then be displayed sequentially to communicate the entire dance performance.

    <p>Dance in Analog and Digital is my Interactive Media Arts(IMA) capstone/thesis project. It is to visualize the difference of human movement using analog and digital methods. To do this, I will simultaneously record a solo dance performance with both long-exposure film photography and a Microsoft Kinect’s depth and motion sensing. The deliverable will be a sequence of imaging chronicling the entire dance performance into an estimated 20 different fragments. The viewer will then be able to view each fragment as a long exposure film print, as a representation of analog means, and an interactive lenticular that will allow the viewer to see a short video clip by changing their perspective, as a representation of digital means. The fragments will then be displayed sequentially to communicate the entire dance performance.</p>

<p>This project is a culmination of my skill set as I am applying the film photography techniques I learned in Prague with the Kinect motion sensing skills I learned in IMA. A wholly original concept, this project dares to mix means of media that haven’t been mixed before and is an opportunity for me to contribute to the fields of work I have always admired in data visualization, photography, and performance based art, while starting quality documentation in areas that have been ill documented, like lenticular printing.</p>
