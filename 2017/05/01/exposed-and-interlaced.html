<p>Conceptual Development:</p>

<p>This idea was formed with my own experiences here at NYU Shanghai and also when I studied abroad. I took the Intro to Film Photography class in NYU Prague with the great artist/Professor Bara Mrazkova. I loved every second of the class and also the time I got to spend in the darkroom, the unexpected surprises along with the special personality of the film, and the delicate nuance. I also took a class with Professor Moon last seamster at NYU Shanghai called Kinetic Interfaces, where I had the chance to experiment with Microsoft Kinect, a motion sensing device and the body movement data. For the final project of that class, I did a dance collaboration with my friend Ann. I was pretty amazed by how the human body was recognized and captured.</p>

<p>I had this idea of doing human size photogram to show the human movement. According to Wikipedia, “a photogram is a photographic image made without a camera by placing objects directly onto the surface of a light-sensitive material such as photographic paper and then exposing it to light. The usual result is a negative shadow image that shows variations in tone that depends upon the transparency of the objects used. Areas of the paper that have received no light appear white; those exposed through transparent or semi-transparent objects appear grey” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogram). Then I found a photographic artist Floris Neusüss who did human size photograms (http://www.vonlintel.com/Floris-Neususs.html). I contacted the gallery inquiring about the process and materials and I heard back from them with the answers I needed. However, given the fact that this idea has a really strict requirement on the space, a darkroom with enough space with a big enough pool/bathtub for developing prints, and also the materials, customized size/unusual big size photo papers, which would potentially elevate the cost of the project by a fairly large amount as well as the time consumption. I decided to pivot it.</p>

<p>Instead of analog media taking up the entire project, I though it would be a good idea to bring digital into the field. Kinect can sense and record body motion data in digital form, and film photography is analog way to record things. I started paying attention to the contrast and different between these two means. Although we live in an analog world, almost every single aspect has been heavily digitized. When you go to a concert, you see a wall of iPhones screen lit up; when you go to a museum, you see people with lenses capturing people striking poses with art works; people read pdfs; etc. Almost all the analog media have at least one or multiple replacements that feature convenience on user’s side when it comes to distribution, utilization and manipulation.</p>

<p>Having dance as the as the content that shared by digital and analog approach of data recording, I started looking for media for presenting the data. AJ introduced lenticular and gifpop (https://gifpop.io) to me. Lenticular printing is a technology in which lenticular lenses (a technology that is also used for 3D displays) are used to produce printed images with an illusion of depth, or the ability to change or move as the image is viewed from different angles. I thought this would be a good way to present digital data which essentially is a short snippet of the dance piece and that data is in point-cloud form since digital recorded data can be easily modified and that directly shows how the Kinect device is sensing and selecting the samples, which is those dots where infrared light it emits lands. Same snippet of dance piece was also recorded on a long-exposed negative. After developing the negative, I printed it out with an enlarger onto a light sensitive photo paper. Each fragment of the dance piece has two presentations with one  being long-exposure film print and one being point-cloud lenticular sheet, and in total 10 fragments will be displayed sequentially to communicate the entire dance performance.</p>

<p>The idea of this project is a culmination of my skill set as I am applying the film photography techniques I learned in Prague with the Kinect motion sensing skills I learned in IMA. A wholly original concept, this project dares to mix means of media that haven’t been mixed before and is an opportunity for me to contribute to the fields of work I have always admired in motion capture, film photography, and performance based art, while starting quality documentation in areas that have been ill documented, like lenticular printing.</p>
